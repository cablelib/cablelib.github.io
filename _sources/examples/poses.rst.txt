Poses
======

Poses can be concatenated either through another pose or a 4x4
affine transformation matrix. Here the pose is translated by one
unit in the direction of the x-axis.

.. code-block:: python

   pose = Pose()
   concat_pose = pose.concatenate(Pose([1, 0, 0]))

Now an affine transformation matrix is applied to the default pose.

.. code-block:: python

   affine_transformation_matrix = [
        [1, 0, 0, 0.5],
        [0, 1, 0, -0.5],
        [0, 0, 1, 0.1],
        [0, 0, 0, 1]
    ]

    concat_pose_2 = pose.concatenate(affine_transformation_matrix)

Poses can also be represented as a 4x4 matrix

.. code-block:: python

   matrix = concat_pose_2.get_affine_transformation_matrix()
