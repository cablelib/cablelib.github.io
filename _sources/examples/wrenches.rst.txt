Wrench access
=============

Wrench elements can be accessed with square brackets or the entire
wrench vector can be returned as a list:

.. code-block:: python
   
   wrench = Wrench([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
   
   wrench[0] # == 1
   wrench[1] # == 2
   wrench[2] # == 3
   wrench[3] # == 4
   wrench[4] # == 5
   wrench[5] # == 6

   wrench.data() # == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
